- Fixed bugs:
- If you don't define a variable, the expression is FALSE:

Example:

```php
<?php

echo new div("index.tpl", array("var1" => "some")); // var2 is missing

```

index.tpl

```div
{?( "{$var1}" == "some" && "{$var2}" == "another" )?)
```

Part 1

```div
@else@
```

Part 2

```div
{/?}

```

Output:

Part 2

- If you don't define a variable, the formula will be ignored:

Example:

```php
<?php

echo new div("index.tpl", array("var1" => 2)); // var2 is missing

```

index.tpl

```div
(# {$var1} + {$var2} #)

```

Output:

```div
(# 2 + {$var2} #)
```
