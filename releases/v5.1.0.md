# Release v5.1.0
Date: 2019-07-22

## Description
This release includes:
- Some bug fixes.
- New variable for inline data of preprocessed templates: div.standalone, by default is FALSE. This means that the "foo" variable will not be passed to the template pre-processor. That is, the variables in the parent template will be ignored and only the data specified in the line will be used.
- Do not include anything within the conditional blocks if the conditions have not been resolved. This check prevent infinite loops.
- Priority change for items over filesystem when include o preprocess templates. To force load data from external file, please type the path or full path (ex: block.json) var1: "value1" var2: "value2" } =}.
- Improved the translator. Now you can translate from and to other dialects.
- Fixed dynamic include's paths inside loops.
- Fixed and improve getAuxiliaryEngine.
- Fixed a bug with getAuxiliaryEngine (clone vs assignment).
- Added some new system vars.
- Div.class_name: the name of current invoked class ('div' or child of 'div').
- Div.super_class_name: the name of super parent of current invoked class name (normally is 'div').
- Code review.
- Changed scope of ->loadTemplateProperties() to public.
- Other minor fixes.
- Automatic update of template source code after prepareDialect() ...
- ... && new param for ->prepareDialect() for disable automatic update.
- Re-thinking the change in **June 10, 2013** about invalid JSON in assignments. Is important the dynamic path of JSON files.
- Important improvement for loading JSON data from relative path in template variable's assignment.
- Bug fix on constructor, when div var is an object and not an array.
- Added file_exists as allowed function.
- Added in_array as allowed function.
- Optimize the code: change "is_null" as "=== null", because is_null is 250ns slower (in favor of PHP 5).
- Bug fix: better resolution of tags with empty suffix. In this example "list.filter" is a substring of "list.filter.category", and then exists resulting unexpected code if $list.filter is false.
- Important change!: Now NULLs vars exists and are replaced with empty strings.
- Important change!: Fix scope of pre-processed templates inside loops.
- Divengine namespace.
- Bug fix: Fix scope of standalone pre-processed templates. This fix prevents infinite loops and is useful for recursive pre-process in a component based design.
- Bug fix in div::scanMatch.
- Improved: Better resolution of default template for child classes of div, using Reflection.
