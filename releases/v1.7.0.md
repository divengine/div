Date: 2012-04-05

## Description

April 05, 2012

- Recovering a lost feature. In version 1.5, to improve the algorithms, a mistake broke formula handling. Now in version 1.7 it works again just as quickly.

- Added a new feature for programmers in the constructor of div class with new parameter: IGNORE SOME VARIABLES. Example:

```php
// ignoring the "name" variable
echo new div("index.tpl", array(
"name" => "Rafael",
"age" => 25), array("name")
);
```

- Prevent a bugs with length two first parameters as filenames, in the div constructor
- Release the 1.7 version
