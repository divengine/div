# Release v1.9.0

## Description

April 09, 2012

- Fix some grave bugs in iteration features and other improvements.

- Added new features:
- Custom item variable for lists and mark =>. For example:

```html
{= clients: [
    {
        name: 'John',
        products: [{name: 'Banana', price: 1.2},{name: 'Potato', price: 1.3}]
    }
    ]
=}

[$clients] client =>  <!--{ "client" is the item variable }-->
    [$products]
        {$client.name} - {$name}<br>   <!--{ several properties with the same 
                                             name in several iteration levels }-->
    [/$products]
[/$clients]

```

- Custom item variable for iterations: you now can specify the iteration variable. For example:

```div
[:1,100,i:]
    The current value is {$i}
[/]

```

- Nested iterations. The following example...

```html
[:1,10,i:]
    [:1,10,j:]
        {$i} * {$j} = (# {$i} * {$j} #) <br>
    [/]
[/]

```

...is similar to:

```php
<?php

for($i=1; $i<=10; $i++)
for($j=1; $j<=10; $j++)
echo "{$i} * {$j} = ".($i * $j). "<br>";

?>

```

- New variable for iterations and lists's cycle

- $_list, that it contains the list's name.

For example:

```div
[$products]
    {$_list} <!--{ This output 'products' }-->
[/$products]

```

Div associates a name to each iteration that you define. With this new feature you can know the name of the iteration inside the cycle of the iteration.

Also, if you use the recursion, you can work now with the name of the list thanks to this new variable that doesn't collapse with a variable inside the cycle.

For example:

```div
{= list: "products",
   products: [
```

count: 3, list: ["Banana", "Potato" , "Rice"]

```div
   ]
=}

[{$list}]
    {$_list} <--{ This shows the same thing that {$list} that is 'products' ... }--> 
    {$list}  <--{ This shows the count of items of [$list] }-->
    [$list]  <--{ and this list is a list into the parent cycle }-->
        {$value}, <--{ This shows Banana, Potato, Rice }-->
    [/$list]
[/{$list}]

```

- $_item, that it contains the list's item

For example:

```div
{= products: [
    {
        name: "Banana",
```

price: 1.2

```div
},
{
    name: "Potato",
```

price: 1.3

```div
    }
] =} 

[$products]
    {$_item} <!--{ This show the count of object's properties }-->
    {$_item.price} is similar to {$price}
[/$products]

```

- $_key, that it contains the item's key

For example:

```div
[$products]
    [$_item] <!--{ showing the all properties of object }-->
        {$_key}: {$value} <!--{ showing "property: value" }-->
    [/$_item] 
[/$products]

```
