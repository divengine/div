# Release v2.0.0
Date: 2012-04-14

## Description


- Added a new variable for the cycles: $_order, that is $_index + 1.
   The index begins with 0. The order bigins with 1. This is util when you
   need build a ordered list without <OL> tag and reused item template.

   For example:

   The ordered list:
   ---

   [$list]
           {% reused %}
   [/$list]

   The reused template reused.tpl:
   ---

   ?$_order {$_order}. $_order? Name: {$name} Address: {$address}

   On the other hand if you use the following template for reuse.tpl,
   the first order number will be hidden and the template is more complicated:

   ?$_index (# {$_index} + #). $_index? Name: {$name} Address: {$address}

- Added new variable's modifiers: html and br

    {html:variable} convert all applicable chracters to HTML entities (see the
    documentation of htmlentities() PHP function)

    {br:variable} convert all \n to <br/>

- Fixed bugs of recursivity and recovered the high priority of variables into the cycles.

- Release the 2.0 Version
