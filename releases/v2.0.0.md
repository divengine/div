# Release v2.0.0
Date: 2012-04-14

## Description
This release includes:
- Added a new variable for the cycles: $_order, that is $_index + 1. The index begins with 0. The order begins with 1. This is useful when you need to build an ordered list without <OL> tag and reused item template.
- Added new variable's modifiers: html and br.
- Fixed bugs of recursion and recovered the high priority of variables into the cycles.
