# Release v2.0.0

Date: 2012-04-14

## Description

April 14, 2012

- Added a new variable for the cycles: $_order, that is $_index + 1. The index begins with 0. The order begins with 1. This is util, for example, when you need build a ordered list without <ol> tag and reused item template in HTML.

For example:

The ordered list:

```div
[$list]
        {% reused %}
[/$list]
```

The reused template reused.tpl:

```div
?$_order {$_order}. $_order? Name: {$name} Address: {$address}
```

On the other hand if you use the following template for reuse.tpl, the first order number will be hidden and the template is more complicated:

```div
?$_index (# {$_index} + #). $_index? Name: {$name} Address: {$address}

```

- Added new variable's modifiers: html and br

```div
{html:variable} convert all applicable characters to HTML entities (see the 
```

documentation of `htmlentities()` PHP function)

```html
{br:variable} convert all \n to <br/>
```

- Fixed bugs of recursion and recovered the high priority of variables into the cycles.

- Release the 2.0 Version
