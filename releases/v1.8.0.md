# Release v1.8.0

Date: 2012-04-07

## Description

April 07, 2012

- Recovering a lost feature. In version 1.5, to make the algorithms more efficient, we made a mistake and broke orphan-part cleanup. Now in version 1.8 it works again just as quickly.

- Fix some grave bugs.

- Added new features:
- If a var contain an object, {$var} will be replaced with the count of properties
- Sub matches: now you can write ($var:0,20} or {$var:20} to replace this mark with substr($var, 0, 20);

With this new feature you can chop a text in half thank to the formulas, for example:

```div
{$text: (# {%text} / 2 #)} <!--{ first half }-->
{$text: (# {%text} / 2 #), (# {%text} / 2 #)} <!--{ second half }-->

```

You can also make use of the variable's modifiers:

```div
{^text: 1} <!--{ first character to uppercase }-->

```

- Release the 1.8 version.

Note: The new added features made a little slower the engine. We are working in the improvement of the algorithms.
