# Release v1.8.0
Date: 2012-04-07

## Description

- Recovering a lost functionality. In version 1.5 to make the algorithms more efficient
we made a mistake and break functionality of the clean the orphan parts. Now in version 1.8
is working again just as quickly.

- Fix some grave bugs.

- Added new funtionalities:
    - If a var contain an object, {$var} will be repleace with the count of properties
    - Sub matches: now you can write ($var:0,20} or {$var:20} to replace this mark with
      substr($var, 0, 20);

      With this new functionality you can chop a text in half thank
      to the formulas, for example:

      {$text: (# {%text} / 2 #)} <!--{ first half }-->
      {$text: (# {%text} / 2 #), (# {%text} / 2 #)} <!--{ second half }-->

      You can also make use of the variable's modifiers:

      {^text: 1} <!--{ first character to uppercase }-->

- Release the 1.8 version.

Note: The new added features made a little slower the engine. We are working
in the improvement of the algorithms.
