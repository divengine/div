# Release v2.1.0
Date: 2012-05-08

## Description
This release includes:
- Changed mixedBool() and parseMatch() methods for trim the string values.
- Enabled two new properties for PHP developers: $__src and $__packages.
- If you want that the names of the files have a prefix, specify it in constant PACKAGES or in the property $__packages of a class that extends the div. See.
- Added new constant DIV_DEFAULT_TPL_FILE_EXT for define a template file extension. You can define this constant BEFORE include the div.php script. The default value for this constant is the string "tpl".
- Added new constant DIV_DEFAULT_DATA_FILE_EXT for define a data file extension. You can define this constant BEFORE include the div.php script. The default value for this constant is the string "json".
- Implement the show() method.
- If you don't pass the value of $src for the div class constructor, then Div assumes that $src is the name of the class :).
- Enabled the div extends for OOP in the programmer side. The name of the properties should not begin with __ (double underscore). See the follow example.
- Added a new functionality: pre-processed parts.
