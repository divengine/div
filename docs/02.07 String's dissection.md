# 2.7 String's dissection

Scalar values can be treated as strings and accessed as sequences of characters. You can access individual characters using dot notation and iterate over them as if they were a list.

Example

```
{= name: "Peter" =}

{$name.0}
{$name.1}

{= x: 537 =}

{$x.0}
{$x.1}

[$name]{$value} [/$name]

[$x] {$value} * [/$x] = (# [$x] {$value} * [/$x] 1 #)
```

Output

```
P

e

5

3

P e t e r

5 * 3 * 7 = 105
```
