# 1.5 Install

Div is distributed as a Composer package. This is the recommended path because it resolves dependencies (including `divengine/functions`) and configures autoloading.

```bash
composer require divengine/div
```

For legacy environments without Composer, you can vendor the sources manually:

1. Copy `src/div.php` from this repository into your project.
2. Copy `src/functions.php` from the `divengine/functions` repository into your project.
3. Load both files in your bootstrap before creating any `div` instances.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . "/path/to/functions.php";
require_once __DIR__ . "/path/to/div.php";
```
