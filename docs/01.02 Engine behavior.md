# 1.2 Engine behavior

Div does not process templates in a single top-down pass.

Instead, the engine repeatedly parses and transforms the entire template until no further changes can be made. Each cycle applies the parsing rules (includes, conditions, loops, replacements, modifiers, and related blocks) to the current state of the template.

The process stops when a stable result is reached (a fixed point) or when a safety limit is met.

Pseudo-code (conceptual):

```text
template = original
do:
    previous = template
    template = parse_pass(template, data)
while template != previous and cycles < MAX
```

This iterative behavior allows templates to generate intermediate structures that are evaluated in later cycles. As a result, Div supports meta-templates and templates that generate other templates without relying on recursive calls or hidden execution state.
