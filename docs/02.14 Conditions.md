# 2.14 Conditions

Conditions evaluate a full boolean expression rather than a single boolean variable. The expression is interpreted as PHP after template substitution, so the resulting expression must be valid PHP.

**Syntax**

```
{?( ... expression ... )?}
    ... some code here ...
@else@
    ... some another code here ...
{/?}
```

**Example**

index.php

```php
echo new div('index.tpl', [
    'products' => [
        ['name' => 'Banana', 'price' => 20.5],
        ['name' => 'Potato', 'price' => 10.8]
    ]
]);
```

index.tpl

```
{?( {$products} > 0 )?}
    There are {$products} products in the warehouse
@else@
    There are not products in the warehouse
{/?}
```

Output

```
There are 2 products in the warehouse
```

**Quoting rule**

If a variable is compared as a string, wrap the replacement in quotes so the final expression is valid PHP.

Correct:

```
{?( "{$userRole}" === "guest" )?}
    {% loginPage %}
@else@
    {% dashboard %}
{/?}
```

After substitution:

```
"guest" === "guest"
```

Incorrect (unquoted value):

```
{$userRole} === "guest"
```

After substitution:

```
guest === "guest"
```
