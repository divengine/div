# 2.2 Variables (information, content...)

Templates operate on "information" rather than strict data types. Arrays and objects are normalized so that both can be accessed uniformly. Nested values are accessed with the dot operator.

Example:

**index.php**

```php
<?php

echo new div('index.tpl', [
    'single' => 'something',
    'complex' => [
        'single' => 45,
        'subcomplex' => [
            'single' => 60
        ]
    ]
]);

$complex = (object) [
    'single' => 45,
    'subcomplex' => ['single' => 60]
];

echo new div('index.tpl', [
    'single' => 'something',
    'complex' => $complex
]);
```

**index.tpl**

```php
Single value: {$single}
Single value into complex var: {$complex.single}
And more: {$complex.subcomplex.single}
```

**Output**

```php
Single value: something
Single value into complex var: 45
And more: 60
```
