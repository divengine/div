# 1.4 Core operations

Div exposes three fundamental operations:

- Compile: merge a template with a model and produce text output.
- Transform: generate a new model by reusing compilation.
- Compose: combine the results of multiple executions into a single deliverable.

Output reuse and chaining:

```text
Stage 1:
Template A + Model -> Output Text A
                       |
                       v
Stage 2:
Template B + (Output Text A as input)
            -> Output Text B
```

These operations can be freely combined to build complex generation and transformation workflows.
