# 1.4 Core operations

Div exposes three fundamental operations:

- Compile: merge a template with a model and produce text output.
- Transform: generate a new model by reusing compilation.
- Compose: combine the results of multiple executions into a single deliverable.

These operations can be freely combined to build complex generation and transformation workflows.
