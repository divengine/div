# 1.3 Dialect system

Div supports multiple template dialects.

A dialect is defined externally as a JSON file. It describes how an alternative template syntax maps to Div’s canonical internal syntax. Dialects do not change the engine or its behavior; they only affect how template syntax is interpreted.

Templates can reference which dialect they are written in using a dedicated tag. This allows different templates, or included fragments, to use different dialects within the same execution.

Dialect translation occurs before parsing, so the internal parser remains consistent regardless of the syntax used in source templates.

Dialect normalization:

```text
Dialect Template
       |
       v
 Dialect Mapping
       |
       v
Canonical Div Template
       |
       v
 Div Parser
       |
       v
   Output Text
```

This makes it possible to:

- avoid syntax collisions with the language or format being generated,
- preserve validity constraints (such as XML-valid templates),
- and work with multiple syntactic conventions in a single generation pipeline.
