# 1.10 Reasons

Div was developed to reuse existing developer knowledge rather than introduce a new, complex template language. The goal is to reduce the learning curve while preserving expressive power.

Features are added only when they are necessary and when they cannot be implemented through existing mechanisms. When a new mechanism is required, the intent is to document it with a clear, reproducible example.

Performance tests indicated that direct string replacement is faster than invoking PHP includes in many scenarios. Although string replacement can use more memory, the tradeoff is acceptable for typical template sizes.

Div also avoids a mandatory caching subsystem. Given its deterministic parsing behavior, learning or memoization strategies can be applied externally when needed.

Finally, the engine is implemented as a single class in a single file to simplify integration into diverse environments.
