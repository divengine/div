# 1.14 The best practices

## 5.1 Keep business logic out of templates

Templates should not compute domain totals or infer missing data. For example, invoice totals should be computed in PHP and passed to the template. The template language is intended for presentation, not for deriving business rules.

## 5.2 Balance template and data responsibilities

Avoid passing excessive data that the template will never use, and avoid placing excessive logic in templates that the engine will discard. Keep the data model and the template in balance so each does only what it is designed for.

## 5.3 Prefer small, reusable templates

Split templates into focused components that serve a single purpose. Do not place unrelated layouts in one file with large conditional blocks. If multiple layouts are needed, use includes or pre-processed templates to compose them intentionally.
