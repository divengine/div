# 4.3 Templates inheritance

Div does not implement explicit inheritance, but equivalent behavior can be achieved with existing features. This section outlines three variants.

## 8.3.1 Variant 1: Switch includes

Use a variable to select which template to include.

```
{% block %}

// or

{% {$block} %}
```

## 8.3.2 Variant 2: Protected template variables

The parent template defines a protected variable for a block. The child template overrides it and includes the parent.

parent.tpl

```
... any code ...
{= block1:

... code of block 1 ...

=}

... another code...

{$block1}
```

child.tpl

```
{= *block1:

    ... another code for block 1 ...

=}

{% parent %}
```

## 8.3.3 Variant 3: Locations

Define locations in the parent and populate them from the child.

parent.tpl

```
... any code ...

(( block1 ))

... another code...

{= parent_block1:

... code block 1 written by the parent ...

=}
```

child.tpl

```
{% parent %}

{{block1
    {$parent_block1}

... The child's content ...

block1}}
```

Output

```
... any code ...

... code block 1 written by the parent ...
... The child's content ...

... another code...
```
