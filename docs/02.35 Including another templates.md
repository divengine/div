# 2.35 Including another templates

Templates can be split into parts and included from a container template.

**Syntax**

```
{% var with path to the template part %}

or

{% path/to/template/part %}
```

**Example**

part.tpl

```
Hello world!
```

index.tpl

```
This is the container template:

{% part %}
```

Output

```
This is the container template:

Hello world!
```

Note: a template cannot include itself.
