# 1.1 Scope and purpose

Div is designed to support workflows based on templates and models, reduce repetition, and enable consistent generation of text-based outputs.

Because the output of the engine is plain text, it can be reused freely:

- as another template,
- as a data model (for example, JSON),
- or as part of a composed result.

This makes it possible to chain executions, build generation pipelines, transform data through templates, and compose multiple outputs into a final result. Code generation, data transformation, and multi-stage compilation all emerge naturally from this model.

In server-side rendering for websites, Div can also be used to maintain a clear separation between logic and presentation by keeping templates focused on structure and models focused on data.
